PantryPal
PantryPal is a project designed to help you keep track of your pantry items and reduce food waste. We’ve all been there—finding that forgotten item buried deep in the pantry, only to discover it expired months ago. With PantryPal, you can stay on top of your pantry inventory and avoid those frustrating moments.

Features
Virtual Pantry: Create a digital copy of your real pantry at home.

Add/Remove Items: Easily add new items when you return from the grocery store and remove them when they’re used up.

Expiry Alerts: PantryPal scans your items daily and notifies you when any are close to their expiry date. You can customize the notification timeframe to suit your needs.

How It Works
Initial Setup: Start by adding all the items in your pantry to PantryPal.

Daily Updates: As you use items in your real pantry, remove them from PantryPal to keep your virtual pantry up-to-date.

Expiry Notifications: PantryPal will alert you when items are nearing their expiry date, helping you use them before they go to waste.
