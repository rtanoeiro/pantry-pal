PantryPal
PantryPal is a project designed to help you keep track of your pantry items and reduce food waste. We’ve all been there—finding that forgotten item buried deep in the pantry, only to discover it expired months ago. With PantryPal, you can stay on top of your pantry inventory and avoid those frustrating moments.

# Available Features

At this current stage, PantryPal is only available for CLI usage.

To start using it, just run ```sh main.sh``` while inside the project directory. Once inside the tool, you can:

- Add/Remove Items: Easily add new items when you return from the grocery store and remove them when they’re used up.

- Check Pantry: Check current items available at your Pantry


# Future Features
In a future update, this project will have a visual UI where you will have the following:

- Expiry Alerts: PantryPal scans your items daily and notifies you when any are close to their expiry date. You can customize the notification timeframe to suit your needs.

- Available to access via your browser in a home-server

- AI Meal Suggestions: If you host a local LLM, you'll be able to use your available pantry items to get a dinner recommendation. If you don't host one, you'll be able to input your AI Provider Token and use that instead.

- Expiry Notifications: PantryPal will alert you when items are nearing their expiry date, helping you use them before they go to waste.
